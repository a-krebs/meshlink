This is not a finished version
------------------------------

Please do not use this library yet.


Requirements
------------

In order to compile MeshLink, you will need a GNU C compiler environment. Please
ensure you have the latest stable versions of all the required libraries:

- OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/) version 1.0.0 or later, with support for
  elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and Galois counter mode (GCM) enabled.

The following libraries are used by default, but can be disabled if necessary:

- zlib (http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)

Features
--------

MeshLink is a library that allows applications to connect to other instances of
itself, and exchange messages in a secure way. MeshLink provides end-to-end
encryption and authentication of messages with perfect forward secrecy. The
MeshLink library starts its own thread which handles all network
communications. The application only needs to register callbacks to get
notified of incoming messages and other important events.

Other noteworthy features are:

- IPv6 support
- NAT traversal (requires at least one node that is not behind a NAT)
- Ed25519 keys (TBD)
- AES-256-GCM encryption and message authentication
