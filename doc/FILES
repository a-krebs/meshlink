MeshLink is based on tinc, and tinc had the following structure for its
directory with configuration files:

/tinc.conf       Main configuration file
/tinc-up         Script to configure the virtual network interface
/ecdsa_key.priv  This node's private key
/hosts/node1     Host configuration file, containing the node's public key,
                 address, and perhaps other information.
/hosts/node2     Another host's configuration file,
/hosts/...       et cetera.

For MeshLink, we don't have any scripts, and neither the application nor the
user is supposed to read or edit the configuration files in any way. Therefore,
it might be a good idea to simplify them to the point that we are left
with:

/meshlink.conf    Contains only the local node's Name and Port.
/ecdsa_key.priv   Contains the private key, in binary.
/nodes/node1      Contains only the public key and a list of known addresses.
/nodes/node2      Another node's key and addresses,
/nodes/...        et cetera.

Example /meshlink.conf:

Name = foo
Port = 12345

Example /nodes/foo:

PublicKey = 19fj193f12d1m02dj12089cn
Address = foo.example.com 18529
Address = 93.184.216.119 18529
Address = 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7 18529
