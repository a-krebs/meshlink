TODO list for MeshLink
----------------------

Refactoring: getting rid of global variables. Ultimately, no global variables
should be used by the library (if possible). Tinc uses quite a lot of global
variables. Refactoring this should go into steps:

* Temporarily create a global meshlink_handle_t *mesh (done)
* Move global variables to meshlink_handle_t (partially done)
  - This means moving the declaration from the old .h file to meshlink_internal.h inside meshlink_handle_t
  - Then doing sed 's/variable/mesh->&/g' *.c -i, and running make to check for any errors

After that is completed:

* Add meshlink_handle_t *mesh as the first argument to functions that need it

Then:

* Write code for all the functions in meshlink.c (some can be moved from libmeshlink.c)

Other tasks:

* Use snprintf() instead of xasprintf() when generating filenames
  - Use char filename[PATH_MAX] on the stack. No more need to free().
